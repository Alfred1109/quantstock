# Auxiliary Scripts

This directory is intended for auxiliary scripts that support the quantitative trading system. 
These might include:

- Data downloading and preprocessing scripts.
- Database management scripts (e.g., migration, backup beyond the sqlite_handler).
- Batch backtesting or optimization runners.
- Reporting or analysis scripts not part of the core `main.py` execution.
- Deployment or environment setup helper scripts.

## Usage

Place scripts here and ensure they are executable and well-documented.
Refer to the main project documentation for any conventions regarding script development.
