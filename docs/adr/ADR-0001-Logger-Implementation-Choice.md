# ADR-0001: Logger Implementation Choice

**Date:** 2024-08-02

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

A robust logging mechanism is crucial for monitoring, debugging, and auditing the quantitative trading system. Key requirements include configurable log levels, output to both console and file, and a centralized point of access for logging throughout the application.

## Decision

We decided to implement a singleton `Logger` class within the `src/monitoring_module/`. This logger leverages Python's built-in `logging` module and offers the following features:

*   **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a single, globally accessible logger instance across the application, preventing multiple handlers or configurations for the same log stream.
*   **Configurable Log Levels:** Log levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) can be set via the main `config/settings.yaml` file, allowing for different verbosity in development, testing, and production.
*   **Dual Output:** Logs are simultaneously written to the console (for real-time monitoring during development) and to a rotating log file (for persistent storage and later analysis).
*   **Rotating File Handler:** Log files automatically rotate based on size, preventing them from growing indefinitely.
*   **Standardized Format:** Log messages include a timestamp, logger name, log level, and the message content for clarity and easier parsing.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** The `Logger.configure()` method allows for easy setup at application startup based on external configuration.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
*   **Consistency:** All parts of the application use the same logging mechanism and format.
*   **Maintainability:** Centralized configuration and implementation make it easier to manage logging behavior.
*   **Flexibility:** Log levels and output destinations can be easily changed without modifying application code.
*   **Testability:** While singletons can sometimes complicate testing, the logger can be configured for test environments (e.g., lower log levels, different output files or no file output) or potentially mocked if needed for very specific unit tests, although its primary role is as a system-wide utility.

**Negative:**
*   **Global State:** The singleton pattern introduces a form of global state. However, for a cross-cutting concern like logging, this is often an accepted trade-off.
*   **Initial Setup:** Requires explicit configuration at the start of the application.

## Alternatives Considered

1.  **Direct use of `logging` module:** Directly configuring and using the `logging` module in various parts of the application. This was rejected due to potential for inconsistent configurations and difficulty in managing handlers centrally.
2.  **Third-party logging libraries (e.g., Loguru):** While offering more advanced features out-of-the-box, the decision was made to stick with the built-in `logging` module for simplicity and to minimize external dependencies for such a core utility, as the required features were achievable with it.
